[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/SUNYGeneseo/SpringApp/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://github.com/SUNYGeneseo/SpringApp/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This is an HTML5 web app that uses CSS and JavaScript to provide a visual representation of the solution to a second order differential equation for spring motion. The visuals are represented in the form of a graph of the solution as well as a spring that oscillates in correspondance to the solution.
